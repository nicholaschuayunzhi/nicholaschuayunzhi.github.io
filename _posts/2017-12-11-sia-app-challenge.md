For SIA App Challenge 2017, our team developed a mobile application to digitize
SIA's [Singapore Stopover Holiday](https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/plan-travel/packages/singapore-stopover-holiday/).

The app aims to help customer in the following ways:
- Remove the need for "hard copy" tickets
- Help customers identify nearby attractions (that they have paid for) using Google Maps
- Provide real-time information of attractions
- Alert customers of discounts nearby
- Provide information for bus routes

I worked mainly on the Front End using React Native. Our submission managed to reach the final round (top 8).
