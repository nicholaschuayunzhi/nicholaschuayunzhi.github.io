Inspired by our CS2020 Final Assignment on Maze Generation and Path Finding,
a friend and I decided to develop a hexagonal maze in Unity.

We modified our Java code for square grid maze to support 6 sides and
wrote a C# Script for it. The maze is generated using recursive backtracking.

I worked on the maze generation and pathfinding in C#.
