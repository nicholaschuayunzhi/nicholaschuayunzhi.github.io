My team and I worked on an Address Book Application written in Java for CS2103.

We developed Unify, an address book designed specially for computing students who
love to multitask and prefer the use of command line interface to execute
functions as fast as possible. Unify is also built to teach and encourage users
to learn and master the usage of a command line interface.

We were given a base application of about 6000 lines of code and were tasked to
follow an iterative development cycle, producing weekly features for the app.

I was project lead and also in charge of the UI, working with Java and JavaFX.
