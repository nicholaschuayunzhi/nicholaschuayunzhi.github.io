For NUSâ€™s Orbital 2017, my partner and I developed collaborate!, an online collaborative web application that simulates a table top discussion for projects/teaching/learning while leveraging on technology.

collaborate! won an honourable mention in the Apollo 11 category, which is the highest tier in the Orbital project.

I worked on the frontend, using React + Redux with Socket.io.
