    this.place is a puzzle platformer that incorporates block pulling developed in **Unity**.


    I worked with a team of 5 as the **lead programmer**, designing the underlying architecture of the block
    behaviours.

    I developed a plugin system with **ScriptableObjects** to allow for modular block behaviours.
    I also developed **seamless level loading** and contributed to the **post processing/lighting**.


    The game won 2nd at The 12th SoC Term Project Showcase. [Trailer](https://youtu.be/WkXQZ-q83Zo)
