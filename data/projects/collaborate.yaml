  For NUSâ€™s Orbital 2017, my partner and I developed collaborate!, an online
  collaborative web application that simulates a table top discussion for
  projects/teaching/learning while leveraging on technology.


  collaborate! won an honourable mention in the Apollo 11 category, which is the
  highest tier in the Orbital project.


  I worked on the frontend, using React + Redux with Socket.io.
