    Birdman the Renegade is a 3rd person procedural dungeon crawler where you must fight your way through
    waves of enemies.

    This game was developed in **Unity** as part of Georgia Tech's VGDev Club.

    I contributed an enemy called Hammy (the hammerhead). I created his Model, Textures and Animations using
    **Blender**. I also designed his AI using **State Machines** and **Behaviour Trees**.

    You can watch some gameplay [here](https://youtu.be/OHYYJ6RmfOo).
