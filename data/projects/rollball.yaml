    For my **Computer Graphics** Class project, we were tasked to create interesting compositions of 3D
    Objects. So I decided to create a game.


    The game was written in **C++**, using **OpenGL** api.


    Heres a video of the [gameplay](https://www.facebook.com/nicholaschuayunzhi/videos/10155727268421250/) with
    the instructions!
