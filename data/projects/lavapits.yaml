    Inspired by our CS2020 Final Assignment on Maze Generation and Path Finding,
    a friend and I decided to develop a hexagonal maze in Unity.


    We modified our Java code for square grid maze to support 6 sides and wrote
    a C# Script for it. The maze is generated using recursive backtracking.


    I worked on the maze generation and pathfinding in C#.
