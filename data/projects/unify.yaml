  My team and I worked on an Address Book Application written in **Java** for CS2103.


  We were given a base application of about **6000 lines of code** and were tasked to
  follow an **iterative development cycle**, producing weekly features for the app.


  I was **project lead** and also in charge of the **UI**, working with **Java and JavaFX**.
  I implemented **tab completion** and **user avatars**.
